# wiishopTIDS
Wii Shop titleids (ccs folder/title images) repository (no downloads!1!1)

[[ NOTE TO ME: DO NOT COMBINE CCS-ONLY AND MAIN I SWEAR TO GOD YOU WILL RUIN EVERYTHING DUMMY ]]

this is to have the image of every game inside the ccs folder in the wii shop channel easily visible, no more needing to search up the title id to know what game it is!


NOTICE: THE UNKNOWNONES FOLDER IS INCOMPLETE.
